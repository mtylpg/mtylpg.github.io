                        Designed curriculum, presentations and workshops to promote inclusive thinking across product teams. Built and ran training for development and UX teams to build a shared understanding of how our designs and code can best meet the diverse needs of our users, shifting the accessibility conversation away from post-production compliance audits and towards holistic planning. Contributed designs and usage documentation for a growing design system, particularly around interactive components.

                        Helped compliance team facilitate VPATs, leading user mapping sessions with product leadership to build out a complete understanding of the user flows students rely on to participate fully in online degrees, and using auditor feedback to write development tickets and pair with developers to address accessibility debt across those flows.

                            My largest project at 2U to date, including all the steps from “recognize structural problems” to “work with PM to convince SVPs that we need to address these problems” to “pair with developers to cover weird edge cases from the current iteration of a solution to all those problems.” The connection to accessibility came naturally (the whole thing started with a 1 point ticket to “fix a11y issues in pdf”), but forms are _the_ main interaction point for so many online experiences, and are often the place where lack of a11y knowledge shows.

                        Lead designer for a full reinvention of our cross institution fully responsive online application platform, including internal process mapping, user research, project definition and visual comps. The new product included both a new suite of internal tools that vastly improved scalability and new partner standup time and a new forms design system and style guide for complex user facing forms. This project was also my first venture into the world of accessibility, setting me on a path to specialize in this aspect of the design process.

                        Contributed to later iterations on this platform that evolved our form components into more stable and flexible formats, finding new entry points for our applicant success teams to reach out to potential students, as well as pushing our university partners towards simpler form content and copy, reducing jargon and building a better end user experience.

                        Solo designer for <a href="https://indiemakersyndicate.com/">Indie Maker Syndicate</a> in 2020, an online indie games festival primarily active over Twitch.tv. Built a light brand ascetic (largely out of crafting junk I had around the house), and designed a series of live stream overlays. Ran curation for alt control submissions, as well as conducting live interviews with game developers about their games and creative processes. IMS aimed to give game developers a place to showcase their games in a year where all in person festivals were getting (correctly) canceled for public safety.
