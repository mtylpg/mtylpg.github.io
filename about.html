                Senior Accessibility Designer, building accessible education experiences
            </h3>
            <strong>
                
            </strong>
            <p>
                I've been working in edtech at <a href="https://2u.com/">2U Inc</a> since 2015, designing digital experiences to help universities their degrees online. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My work focuses on the centering of accessibility and inclusive practices in the design process, via training sessions, design system governance and documentation, and working with leadership to better define the goals of our products and ensure all learners can get the most out of our systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to my current role in accessibility, I worked as a Senior Product Designer, with a focus on building internal content management systems as part of a small UX team.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Volunteer Design Work, bringing weird indie games to the stage and screen
            </h3>
            <strong>
                
            </strong>
            <p>
                I run the curation team for the <a href="https://super.magfest.org/indie-arcade"> MAGFest Indie Arcade</a>, an annual games festival celebrating weird control interfaces and interactive art. In addition to the actual curation and submission processes, this role also includes building out assets for livestreams and PR, particularly in 2020 when we put together an online-only event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through friends I've made at MAG, I've also run smaller indie game dev livestreams at <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/">Wonderville</a> in NYC, for which I produced all stream assets.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've lead a pile of friends for annual <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/"> Extra Life</a> charity stream marathons, raising $15k over the past few years. As with the MAG stuff a lot of the work done here isn't <em>really</em> UX related but just like above I end up spending a ton of time building visual languages for our stream content.

            </strong>
            <p>
                From 2014-2015 I led design and front-end development (in that I was the only designer/FE dev) as part of a three person development team for a B2B licensing startup with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iq-license"> iQ License</a>. As the company was just getting started, this involved a lot of UX research work, meeting with clients to learn about their ideal workflows and problems with the current application.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 2012-2013 I worked my first tech job as a Web App Developer at <a href="https://nextjump.com/">Next Jump</a>. My largest projects there were on our checkout system (forms!) and building a new customer help center.
